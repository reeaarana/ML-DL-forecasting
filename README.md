In this particular dataset's case, it was observed that models trained on data without extensive feature engineering outperformed their counterparts. This phenomenon could be attributed to several factors:

1. Overfitting: Excessive feature engineering, including the addition of numerous features or complex transformations, may lead to overfitting.
2. Loss of information: The use of dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA combined with clustering for feature engineering might result in the loss of original information, which can hinder the model's ability to generalize.
3. Ineffectual features: It is possible that the selected features were not as relevant as intended, impacting the performance of the model.
